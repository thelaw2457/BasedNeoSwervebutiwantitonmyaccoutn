# BasedNeoSwerve

Code for a Neo and SparkMax swerve drive train.

This repo is quite obviously based off of [BaseFalconSwerve](https://github.com/Team364/BaseFalconSwerve), however, is intentionally not a fork and not easily hot-swappable if converting to or from Falcon swerve. This is to encourage teams to really look over the code and not simply copy and paste it. Please spend the time to understand this code, as swerve code can be difficult to maintain and debug.
